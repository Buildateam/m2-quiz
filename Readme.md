Magento 2 Quiz Plugin.

Create and manage quizzes using the M2 Quiz plugin. Managing and creating new quizzes is simple and intuitive. 

You can create unlimited questions and unlimited answers. The plugin uses the Advanced Search Functionality at it’s core and allows to funnel your customers through an interesting question funnel. The plugin also saves the quiz results and matching products for later use. For each quiz question you can define product attributes that match the answer. You can add images, hex color blocks, etc to the questions. Answers can be multiple select. You can have questions that depend on previous questions too!

For example if you sell beauty products you can ask your customer:

‘What is your skin color?’

‘What is your eyes color?’

‘What skin problems do you have?’

And then based on the answers, which you can pair to product attributes that are used to search through Magnto's built in advanced search function, you can display matching products that can solve your customer problems. This requires that products have the same attributes selected and enabled for advanced search.
